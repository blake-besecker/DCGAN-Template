anime_faces.py is the code for the model. It's trained with the anime-faces dataset from huggingface:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggan/anime-faces
It's trained from files locally. You'll need to download that set and import it into your local repo to train.
Or you can download the model already trained as I've provided, and generate as many fake people as you want!
